Iris Flower Classification Project

Overview

This project involves building a simple machine learning model to classify iris flowers into different species based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset.

Project Structure

	•	data/: Contains the Iris dataset (e.g., iris.csv).
	•	notebooks/: Jupyter Notebooks used for data exploration and analysis.
	•	01_data_exploration.ipynb: Initial data exploration.
	•	02_model_training.ipynb: Model training using a decision tree classifier.
	•	saved_models/: Saved machine learning models.
	•	iris_decision_tree_model.joblib: Trained decision tree model.
	•	README.md: Overview of the project (you are here).

Getting Started

	1.	Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/iris-classification-project.git


	2.	Navigate to the project directory:

cd iris-classification-project


	3.	Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


	4.	Run the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for data exploration and model training.
	5.	Use the trained model for making predictions on new data.

Dependencies

	•	pandas
	•	matplotlib
	•	scikit-learn
	•	joblib

Install the dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

	•	Explore the Jupyter Notebooks in the notebooks/ directory for detailed analysis.
	•	Use the trained model in your own Python script or application. Example code:

import joblib

# Load the saved model
loaded_model = joblib.load('saved_models/iris_decision_tree_model.joblib')

# Make predictions on new data
new_data = [[5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2], [6.2, 3.4, 5.4, 2.3]]
predictions = loaded_model.predict(new_data)

print("Predictions on New Data:")
for i, prediction in enumerate(predictions):
    print(f"Example {i + 1}: Predicted Class - {prediction}")
